    <h1>Famous Sculptures</h1>
      <p>sculpture, an artistic form in which hard or plastic materials are worked into three-dimensional art objects. 
        The designs may be embodied in freestanding objects, in reliefs on surfaces, 
        or in environments ranging from tableaux to contexts that envelop the spectator.
    An enormous variety of media may be used, including clay, wax, stone, metal, fabric, glass, wood, plaster, rubber, 
    and random “found” objects. Materials may be carved, modeled, molded, cast, wrought, welded, sewn, assembled, 
    or otherwise shaped and combined.</p><br>
