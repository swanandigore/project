    <h1>Famous Paintings</h1>
     <p>Painting is a visual art form where color or pigment is applied to a surface, typically with a brush, to create a picture or artwork. It's a way to express ideas and emotions using elements like color, shape, line, and texture. Various forms of painting exist, depending on the material used (e.g., mural, easel, panel, miniature).
        Painting is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called "matrix"[1] or "support").[2] The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush. Other implements, such as palette knives, sponges, airbrushes, the artist's fingers, or even a dripping technique that uses gravity may be used. 
        One who produces paintings is called a painter. </p><br>
